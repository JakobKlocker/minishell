While working on the Minishell 42 project, students learn several important concepts and skills related to systems programming and operating systems. Some of these include:

    Processes and system calls: Students learn about processes and how to use system calls to create, manage, and manipulate processes.

    Memory management: Students learn about memory allocation and deallocation and how to manage memory efficiently.

    Input/output: Students learn how to handle input and output streams, as well as how to implement basic input/output redirection.

    Signals: Students learn about signals and how to handle them in their shell, including how to catch and respond to signals like Ctrl-C or Ctrl-D.

    Parsing: Students learn about parsing and how to break down user commands into tokens, which can then be executed by the shell.

    Command execution: Students learn how to execute commands entered by the user using system calls like execve.

    Environment variables: Students learn how to handle environment variables and implement basic functionality for setting and getting environment variables.

    Pipes: Students learn about pipes and how to implement basic pipe functionality to enable the user to pipe output from one command to the input of another.

Overall, the Minishell 42 project provides students with valuable experience working with the C programming language, as well as a deeper understanding of how shells and operating systems work.
